## Setup
 
1. Install latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)

2. From the project folder, execute the following command: 
 ```
 npm install
 ```
 This will install all required dependencies, including a local version of Webpack that is going to build and bundle the app. 

3. To run the app execute the following command:
 ```
 npm start
 ```
 This command starts the Webpack development server that serves the built bundles. You can now browse the app at http://localhost:8080. Changes in the code will automatically build and reload the app.
