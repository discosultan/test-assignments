        Vendor libraries are loaded from external sources for simplicity.
        Our app is bundled together using WebPack mainly in order to be able to
        declare Angular component templates as external html files. Otherwise,
        we would have to resort to inline string based templates since using
        component's templateUrl is complicated (due to security reasons) without
        serving the app from a web server.
        Scripts are loaded in the head section since there is no point in
        deferring them. We can't display anything without having fully loaded
        our app anyway. Material Design Lite's JavaScript could benefit from
        'async' attribute.
