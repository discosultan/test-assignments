# Weather Portal

Example weather portal SPA built on [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) using [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) data. No graphs, sadly :(

## Executing the app

Simply run `index.html` from **dist** folder.

## Tests

Tests have been omitted due to time constraints (that lame excuse :) ).

## Repository structure

- **app** - Root of the SPA application. All the components are divided into their corresponding folders based on angular component type.

- **dist** - Contains the full package ready for distribution. No server is required to run the app.
